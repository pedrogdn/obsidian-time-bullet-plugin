# Time Bullet Plugin for Obsidian

> Automatically add timestamps to your lists with minimal effort ðŸ•’

## Features

- **Auto-timestamp task lists**: Converts `-[t]` to `- [HH:MM]` with current time when you press Space
- **Timestamp continuity**: When pressing Enter on a timestamped list item, the new line automatically includes the
  current time
- **Minimal interference**: Works naturally within your existing workflow
- **No configuration needed**: Simple, intuitive functionality right out of the box

## Usage

### Creating a timestamped list

1. Type `-[t]`
2. Press the Space key
3. The text becomes `- [{{time_stamp}}]` with the current time formatted based on your settings (default is HH:MM).
4. Continue writing your note

### Continuing a timestamped list

1. Press Enter at the end of a line that starts with `- [{{time_stamp}}]`
2. A new list item with the current time is automatically created
3. Continue with your notes

## Use Cases

- **Meeting notes**: Track when different points were discussed
- **Daily logs**: Document when you completed different tasks
- **Research notes**: Record the time of observations or findings
- **Time tracking**: Keep a simple record of activities throughout your day

## Settings

- **Time format**: (default is HH:MM) - Customize your time format using Dayjs formatting found on the [dayjs documentation](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format)
- **Use UTC**: (default is true) - Use UTC time when creating a timestamp. If false, time will be local to your machine.
