# Time Bullet Plugin for Obsidian

> Automatically add timestamps to your lists with minimal effort 🕒

## Features

- **Auto-timestamp task lists**: Converts `-[t]` to `- [HH:MM]` with current time when you press Space
- **Timestamp continuity**: When pressing Enter on a timestamped list item, the new line automatically includes the current time
- **Minimal interference**: Works naturally within your existing workflow
- **No configuration needed**: Simple, intuitive functionality right out of the box

## Usage

### Creating a timestamped list

1. Type `-[t]` 
2. Press the Space key
3. The text becomes `- [HH:MM]` with the current time
4. Continue writing your note

### Continuing a timestamped list

1. Press Enter at the end of a line that starts with `- [HH:MM]`
2. A new list item with the current time is automatically created
3. Continue with your notes

## Use Cases
